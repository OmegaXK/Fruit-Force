# Fruit-Force
- Start the game by pressing a key
- Go to the door to change between the two rooms
- Eat fruits by touching them
- If you go through a fruit without eating it, than it is an imposter
- In a meeting, vote out the fruits that are imposters
- Try and get past all three meetings to win the game
- Vote wrong, and lose
- Don't touch the imposters too much, or they will kill you
- Enjoy!
